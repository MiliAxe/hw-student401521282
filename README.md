# Mili's Git assignment
Welcome to my repository. âœ¨

Check out the main files [here](warpd).

## What's going on?
This is in fact a fork from rvaiya/warpd (more info in [here](https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd)) I will be trying to add two main features to this great project:

- Don't hide the mouse in normal mode
- Add an option to be able to configure it.

## Screenshots
Checkout the [screenshots](screenshots)!

## Disclaimer
I'm sorry if this project is not marked as "forked", I already have a fork of it on my profile and I can't create multiple forks. This repository is only intended to be available for a short time.
